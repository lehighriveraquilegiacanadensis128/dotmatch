# Benchmark Report

- Platform: `macOS-26.2-arm64-arm-64bit`
- Python: `3.9.6`
- External exact edit-distance baseline: Edlib Python binding with `mode="NW"`, `task="distance"`.
- These graphs compare short global edit-distance workloads. They are not broad aligner benchmarks.

## Evidence Boundary

These results cover short-DNA global edit-distance and threshold matching against Edlib's Python binding.
Comparative performance wording should use native C Edlib, SeqAn, and Parasail comparisons where the scoring model is equivalent.
