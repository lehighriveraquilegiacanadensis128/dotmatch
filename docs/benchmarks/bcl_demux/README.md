# BCL Demultiplexing Benchmark

This is the raw Illumina run-folder barcode demultiplexing evidence track.

Current status: DotMatch supports a first classic per-cycle BCL milestone. CBCL/NovaSeq-style input is still gated as future work. Comparative wording requires real run folders and zero-mismatch validation against BCL Convert or bcl2fastq where available.

The public `public_10x_tiny_bcl` row uses the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger `tiny-bcl` mkfastq demo run folder. The bundled fetch script downloads the 10x sample sheet, the public run-folder archive, and the official Chromium i7 index CSV used to normalize the legacy `SI-P03-C9` index-set alias into concrete index sequences.

Rows with exit code `127` are environment records for missing competitors, not runtime comparisons. They are kept in the raw table so the report is explicit about what was unavailable on this machine.

## Current Best Validated Comparison

DotMatch is 2.94x faster than the fastest validated installed comparator in this CSV (bcl2fastq) on the same host and workflow.

This is not a comparison result by itself: the comparison gate still requires repeated real runs, CBCL evidence, and stricter output validation where read names/paths are comparable.

## Comparison Evidence Gate

Do not describe DotMatch as raw-BCL barcode comparative until this report contains real classic-BCL and CBCL run-folder rows, competitor rows for BCL Convert/bcl2fastq/CUDA-Demux where installable, repeated timing, and `dotmatch bcl-validate` zero-mismatch evidence.

Run `make bcl-comparison-gate` before using comparative wording. The gate intentionally fails on synthetic rows, missing CBCL evidence, missing competitor rows, failed validation, or slower DotMatch throughput.
