# Packaging Notes

DotMatch should ship with three practical install paths:

- source build with `make && make shared`;
- Docker image for reproducible command-line use;
- Python package using the ctypes wrapper and bundled or discoverable native library.

## PyPI

Initial local/GitHub packaging builds the native C core into the wheel as `dotmatch/libdotmatch.{so,dylib}` for Linux and macOS. Wheels are platform-specific but Python-ABI-neutral (`py3-none-<platform>`) because the native library is loaded through `ctypes` rather than the Python C API. The ctypes loader still accepts:

- the bundled platform library in the wheel;
- `DOTMATCH_LIB=/path/to/libdotmatch.{so,dylib}` for source-tree and custom installs.

Use `make python-package-test` to build the wheel, inspect that it contains the native library, install it into a clean virtual environment, and verify `import dotmatch` without `DOTMATCH_LIB` or `PYTHONPATH`.
The same verifier also builds the sdist, confirms it contains `src/qdalign.c` and `include/qdalign.h`, and installs that sdist into a clean virtual environment.

For PyPI, upload the sdist first. Linux binary wheels should go to PyPI only after they are built or repaired as manylinux/musllinux wheels with a tool such as cibuildwheel/auditwheel. Do not upload a raw `linux_x86_64` wheel to PyPI.

## Bioconda

Bioconda should package the native CLI first. The recipe needs:

- `make`
- C compiler and C++ compiler for optional benchmark tools;
- zlib;
- runtime test: `dotmatch dist ACGT AGGT`.

## Docker

The root `Dockerfile` builds the native CLI and shared library on Debian. Example:

```bash
docker build -t dotmatch:dev .
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" dotmatch:dev count --help
```
