# DotMatch Evidence Notes

Use this page when writing the README, website, or release notes. It says what
we can say plainly today, and where we still need more data before making a
broader claim.

The assay list lives in `docs/assay-evidence.json`. Run
`make assay-evidence-ready` after changing it. The check makes sure each lane
has the basics that matter for a public claim: artifacts, commands, comparator
semantics, validation notes, and a clear next step when the evidence is not
there yet. For raw CSV files, it also checks rows, command provenance, exit
codes where present, and recorded zero-mismatch validation columns.

## Current Defensible Statements

| Statement | Status | Evidence | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DotMatch provides exact short-DNA global edit distance and threshold matching for known targets. | Supported | `make test`, `make cli-test`, native C tests, Python tests, `docs/benchmarks/native/README.md` | Not a genome aligner; no CIGAR/SAM/BAM support. |
| The core Levenshtein `k=1` threshold predicate avoids heap allocation for exact, one-substitution, one-insertion, and one-deletion checks. | Supported | `make test`; native allocation regression in `tests/test_qdalign_threshold_alloc.c` | This describes the implementation of the threshold predicate. It does not make a cross-platform speed claim. |
| Indexed assignment preserves native exhaustive-scan semantics for `unique`, `ambiguous`, `none`, and `invalid` outcomes in the supported `k<=2` lanes. | Supported | `dotmatch validate`, native assignment tests, Edlib validation artifacts under `benchmarks/raw/`, Levenshtein `k=2` CLI regression cases | `k=2` count/demux uses the exhaustive assignment fallback; current `N`/IUPAC behavior is literal-byte matching, not wildcard expansion semantics. |
| Public CRISPR guide-counting rows are validated. | Supported | `make public-crispr-evidence-gate` passes; report at `docs/benchmarks/public_crispr/README.md` | Supports the documented MAGeCK/Yusa public-data workflow, not universal CRISPR superiority. |
| Extended CRISPR comparison rows are validated. | Supported | `make crispr-comparison-gate` passes; report at `docs/benchmarks/crispr_comparison/README.md` | Applies to the recorded CRISPR guide-counting lanes and their documented comparator semantics. |
| FASTQ count and demux workflows can optionally gate one-edit substitution and read-insertion rescue by observed Sanger Phred quality. | Supported | `make cli-test`; `--max-correction-qual` CLI regression cases | This is a deterministic correction filter, not a calibrated sequencing-error probability model. Read-deletion rescue has no observed edited base to score and is not rejected by this gate. |
| FASTQ count and demux workflows support optional Levenshtein `k=2` fixed-window correction. | Supported | `make cli-test`; Levenshtein `k=2` count/demux regression cases | Hamming remains limited to `k=0` and `k=1`; `--indel-window` remains a `k=1` option. |
| DotMatch has a first paired/combinatorial fixed-window counting command. | Supported | `make cli-test`; `pair-count` CLI regression case | Counts only reads where both target windows are uniquely assigned. This is not a perturb-seq expression quantification or guide-pair statistical-analysis workflow. |
| DotMatch has a native fixed-position inline barcode demultiplexing command with fixed-length and auto-length barcode sheet modes, and a checked public SRP009896 exact-prefix comparison lane. | Supported | `make cli-test`, `make bench-barcode-comparison`, `make barcode-comparison-gate`, report at `docs/benchmarks/barcode_demux/README.md` | Applies to the checked SRP009896/SRR391079 `k=0` exact-prefix lane with variable-length public example barcodes, Cutadapt anchored no-indel demux, and exact hash-splitter baseline. Broader barcode demultiplexing claims need additional datasets and comparator semantics. |
| DotMatch has a checked public classic per-cycle tiny-BCL demultiplexing milestone. | Supported | `make cli-test`, `make bench-bcl-10x`, `make bcl-tiny-public-gate`, report at `docs/benchmarks/bcl_demux/README.md` | Applies only to the public 10x tiny-BCL classic per-cycle row and count-total validation where available. Do not describe this as CBCL/NovaSeq support or a production Illumina demultiplexing replacement. |
| DotMatch has a checked public CRISPR Guide Capture per-read assignment lane plus a perturb-seq-style guide/feature pair diagnostic lane. | Supported | `make bench-perturb-seq-public`, `make perturb-seq-public-gate`, report at `docs/benchmarks/perturb_seq/README.md` | Applies to the checked 10x GEM-X A375 CRISPR Guide Capture R2 fixed-window assignment lane and exact-slice baseline, plus synthetic pair-count side diagnostics. This is not Cell Ranger UMI/cell-level quantification or perturbation-effect evidence. |
| DotMatch has a checked public feature-barcode per-read assignment lane. | Supported | `make bench-feature-barcode-public`, `make feature-barcode-public-gate`, report at `docs/benchmarks/feature_barcode/README.md` | Applies to the checked 10x TotalSeq-B antibody Feature Barcode R2 fixed-window assignment lane and exact-slice baseline. This is not Cell Ranger UMI/cell-level quantification evidence. |
| DotMatch has a checked public amplicon/panel primer-start assignment lane. | Supported | `make bench-amplicon-panel-public`, `make amplicon-panel-public-gate`, report at `docs/benchmarks/amplicon_panel/README.md` | Applies to the checked nf-core viralrecon ARTIC V3 Illumina R1 fixed-window primer-start assignment lane and exact-prefix baseline, plus synthetic ambiguity diagnostics. This is not amplicon consensus, variant calling, primer trimming, or clinical validation evidence. |
| DotMatch has a checked public fixed-window oligo/adapter prefix assignment lane. | Supported | `make bench-oligo-adapter-public`, `make oligo-adapter-public-gate`, report at `docs/benchmarks/oligo_adapter/README.md` | Applies to the checked fast-adapter-trimming TruSeq R1 fixed-window adapter-prefix assignment lane and exact-slice baseline, plus synthetic ambiguity diagnostics. This is not adapter trimming, primer removal, UMI grouping, or read-merging evidence. |

## Evidence Boundaries

| Area | Check | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Barcode demultiplexing comparisons. | `make barcode-comparison-gate` requires real-data rows, assigned reads, Cutadapt rows, and at least one additional relevant comparator. | The checked public lane is exact-prefix SRP009896/SRR391079 evidence; the built-in fixture remains only a workflow smoke test. |
| Raw BCL demultiplexing comparisons. | `make bcl-tiny-public-gate` checks the narrow public 10x tiny-BCL milestone; `make bcl-comparison-gate` requires real run folders, CBCL evidence where relevant, and production comparator validation before broader wording is used. | The public tiny-BCL row shows that the classic-BCL path works on the tiny fixture. It is not enough for broad BCL comparison wording. |
| Perturb-seq comparisons. | `make perturb-seq-public-gate` requires the synthetic diagnostic lane plus public DotMatch k=0/k=1 guide-capture rows and exact-slice baseline agreement. | The checked public lane supports per-read fixed-window 10x CRISPR Guide Capture assignment only. It does not support guide-per-cell, expression-processing, or perturbation-effect claims. |
| Feature-barcode comparisons. | `make feature-barcode-public-gate` requires the synthetic diagnostic lane plus public DotMatch k=0/k=1 rows and exact-slice baseline agreement. | The checked public lane supports per-read fixed-window 10x antibody Feature Barcode assignment only. It does not support broader CITE-seq, cell-hashing, or cell/UMI quantification claims. |
| Amplicon/panel comparisons. | `make amplicon-panel-public-gate` requires the synthetic diagnostic lane plus public DotMatch k=0/k=1 primer-start rows and exact-prefix baseline agreement. | The checked public lane supports per-read fixed-window ARTIC primer-start assignment only. It does not support consensus generation, primer trimming, variant calling, or clinical interpretation claims. |
| Oligo/adapter comparisons. | `make oligo-adapter-public-gate` requires the synthetic diagnostic lane plus public DotMatch k=0/k=1 rows and exact-slice baseline agreement for the fast-adapter-trimming TruSeq R1 fixed window. | The checked public lane supports adapter-prefix assignment wording only; adapter trimming, primer removal, UMI grouping, read merging, and production adapter workflow claims require separate comparator evidence. |
| General aligner replacement. | No repository check promotes this. | DotMatch does not currently expose reference-index mapping, traceback/CIGAR, SAM/BAM, paired-end mapping, or genome-scale alignment semantics. |
| Native SeqAn/Parasail comparisons. | `make native-comparator-scope-ready` checks the documented scope in `docs/native-comparator-scope.md`. | SeqAn and Parasail are not completed comparator evidence until equivalent scoring semantics, native dependency/version capture, raw CSV rows, generated reports, and zero assignment mismatches are recorded. |
| Package-channel availability. | `make python-package-test` verifies local Linux/macOS wheel and sdist installability. | PyPI, Bioconda, Docker registry, and Zenodo release artifacts are separate distribution channels. |

## Rules For New Public Statements

Before adding a new README, website, or release-note claim, make sure it has:

- exact command lines;
- raw CSV artifacts under `benchmarks/raw/`;
- a generated report under `docs/benchmarks/`;
- correctness validation against the relevant oracle;
- comparator versions and semantics;
- a gate script when the statement is important enough to appear in the README.
